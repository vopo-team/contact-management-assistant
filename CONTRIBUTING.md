## Git standards

### Branches

The name structure of the branch is next: [feature|bug|doc|dev]/[number-of-the-issue]-[name-of-the-branch]

- `feature` prefix is for feature branch
- `bug` prefix is for the branch that will fix the bug
- `doc` prefix is for the branch that will update the documentation
- `dev` prefix is for some general task that is neither feature nor a bug

### Commits

For commit messages we're using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) standard.

## Code style
